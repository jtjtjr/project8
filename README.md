## Project status

We have just started this project

Backend Work work consists of the Planet, Event, and Player class (With their respective testors methods). The general classes (Event, Class) are finished. 
Docker work is progressing fast and SQL work is finished an represented in our EventConnector class which shows the intial steps of connecting our SQL database in the VM to our local code.
Integrating SQL plus Event class is a significant milestone the group aims to show off in the demo for Sprint 1.

Looking forward, we have to integrate the Backend with the Frontend to deliver a semi-complete MVP for Sprint 2.
