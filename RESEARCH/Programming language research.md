## Programming language selection

### Summary of Work

I researched the best programming language to code our game in. It turned out to be a comparison of Python vs Java, since those are the 2 languages we all know.

### Motivation

The choice of language is really important since our entire project is going to be based on what we choose.

### Time Spent

15 mins - finding links
20 mins - processing info form links, thinking about pros/cons

### Results

Python is quite a bit slower, not a big issue if we're doing a text-based game, but relying solely on Python if we were to implement actual graphics would probably be an issue.

Python has more support than Java due to its greater popularity. It's also inherently a more agile language, which would make sense given the focus of this class.

Python has weaker database access than Java[^1]

Python syntax is simpler than Java's, dynamic typing vs static

Java is the way to go for mobile development, btu we're doing desktop-only, moot point[^2]
