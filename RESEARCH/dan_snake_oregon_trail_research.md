# Research Report

### Summary of Work

I researched different implementations of various retro games to get a large idea of how games were programmed back in the day to see how to use it

### Motivation

Understanding how old games were programmed will help us decide on how we should start, specifically on whether there is a good IDE or language that would suit us best

### Time Spent

~30 minutes

### Results

I discovered that the original Oregon trail was written in BASIC, and other old style 'retro' games were written in assembly code. Tetris was written in Pascal. At the time assembly code was the only programming language available. Unfortunatly our team does not have the time to deal with the complexities and redundancies of assembly, BASIC, etc. 

We've decided as a team to use java as a programming language to completly remake the game from the ground up. That way we won't have to deal with the complexities of assembly language or C. Doing so may also make it easier to organize our code between a backend and a frontend, compared to as seen in the oregon trail repository I found, where the code for the game is entirely in one file and the whole game is programmed as a sequence (probably indicating their's redundancy that can be solved by the object-orientedness of java)
