# Research Report

### Summary of Work

I took time to develop my planet ideas so that they match the format of my Frontend Partner, that is every planet now has data about Atmosphere, Affiliations, Danger Level, Amenities, and Several events that coul doccur

### Motivation

Improve on my initial planet ideas by specifying specific information that will be important for the game as we move forward.

### Time Spent

~60 minutes

### Results

Now my half of the creative development for the game is done and I have the following

Bucephalus - Large yellow Gas Giant
Atmosphere: 96% CO_2, 4% N
Amentities:
Landing zone is an orbital platform  - basically a diner and gas station kind of like that place from Space Balls
Refuel Completely
Food purchased at diner
Clean Water (they take service seriously)
Trading can also occur
Danger Level: 2/10
Affiliations: None
EVENTS:
Thunder  - Bucephalus storms sometimes shock the platform 
25% chance that 1 crew member will die
Ripped Off - Diner will rip you off and provide ¾ worth of anything you buy unless you have a weapon
	
Norman’s Rock – tiny gray barren planet
Atmosphere: None
Amenities:
The landing is near the iron mining settlement
Partial Refueling
Trading - though in general prices are very expensive
Purchase resources
Danger level: 3/10
Affiliations: Atlas Station
EVENTS:
Cave in 
Mining operation goes wrong and the mine caves and 1 crew member gets stuck, 
New Crew 
several miners are tired of working here but need help escaping. You can either:
provide them with weapons:
if  successful they join your crew 
If they fail you are chased off by the guards who will kill 2 of your crew on their way out
Ignore their request and leave them behind


Atlas Station – Research Observation Station
Atmosphere: None
Amenities:
You cannot fully refuel here (i.e. if the basic ship has 100 units of fuel you can only get 30)
Limited trading, can only sell resources for cash (albiet scientists will pay highly for it)
Danger: 1/10
Affiliations: None
EVENTS
Asteroid Field
Asteroid field bares down on station and there is a 65% chance your ship will get damaged
Wall Breach
Wall of station gets broken and 1 crew member dies
Also resources may be lost as they fly out the breach
Ezekiel’s Salvation – Ocean planet 
Atmosphere: 50% Oxygen, 20% H2O, 20% Nitrogen, 10% CO2
Amenities
Landing at algae and fishing platform/colony 
can buy items like these for relatively cheap prices (everything else expensive though)
simple religious folk, worship the God … Balenus
Danger 2/10
Affiliations: None
EVENTS:
It was an accident
 accidentally defaced a shrine of Balenus without knowing, they won’t run you out, but  they won’t sell to you anymore
Major Storm
 Storm hits the colony and you can’t left off, it takes a week for the storm to clear. And there is a 45% chance that a massive wave will sweep 2 of your crew away
Mu 6 - Moon orbiting large blue gas giant
Atmosphere: 80% H_2, 20% He
Amenities
Fuel traders, nothing else
Cheap fuel 


Astros Confederation - highly defensive and territorial
Danger: 6/10
Affiliations: Technon 9, Astros Militarium
