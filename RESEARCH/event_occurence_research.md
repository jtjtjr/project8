## Event Occurence for Oregon Trail

### Summary of Work

<!--I researched how event occurence work in the origin game of the oregon trail. -->

### Motivation

<!--I feel like this would help our team understand the game better as this mechanic is one of the core mechanics for the game -->

### Time Spent

<!--about 60 minutes-->

### Results

<!--
The breakdown is that the game generates 16 different events what can occur including 1 no event option.
Each event has a weight that is determined using a random generator and predetermined thresholds that symbolizes the weight of its corresponding event.
This (the random generator number) is looped 16 times and if nothing happens, no special occurance.
Thresholds (weight) for each event is changed baesd on miles traveled.
