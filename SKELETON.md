Overview

This project is a modern reimagining of the Oregon Trail, set in deep space. Players will manage resources, make critical decisions, and navigate procedural events to survive the journey.

Core Features

Procedural Events: Random encounters influenced by crew stats and ship condition.

Resource Management: Oxygen, fuel, food, and morale affect survival.

Decision Trees: Choices impact the journey and its outcomes.

Dynamic Storytelling: Events evolve based on past player actions.

Technology Stack

Language: Java

Frontend: Command-line interface

Database: TBD (to store game events and progress)

Development Considerations

Object-oriented design with a focus on modularity.

Events should be varied and affect player survival.

Database integration for storing game data.

Unit testing and balancing gameplay mechanics.

Research & Decisions

Game Framework: Command-line style to preserve the classic feel.

Programming Language: Java chosen for its versatility and database integration.

Frontend: Basic framework established with initial methods.

Event System: Randomized with weighted probabilities, influenced by game conditions.

Class Structure: Exploring Day vs. Player class interactions.

Next Steps

Finalize object-oriented design approach.

Implement basic event and resource management mechanics.

Establish core game loop and testing framework.

Determine database schema and integration strategy.
