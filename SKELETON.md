Overview

This project is a modern reimagining of the Oregon Trail, set in deep space. Players will manage resources, make critical decisions, and navigate procedural events to survive the journey.

Core Features

Procedural Events: Random encounters influenced by crew stats and ship condition.

Resource Management: Resources and morale affect survival.

Decision Trees: Choices impact the journey and its outcomes.

Dynamic Storytelling: Events evolve based on past player actions.

Technology Stack

Language: Java

Frontend: Command-line interface

Database: SQL database on VM

Development Considerations

Object-oriented design with a focus on modularity.

Events should be varied and affect player survival.

Database integration for storing game data.

Unit testing and balancing gameplay mechanics.

Research & Decisions

Game Framework: Command-line style to preserve the classic feel.

Programming Language: Java chosen for its versatility and database integration.

Frontend: Basic framework established with initial methods.

Event System: Randomized with weighted probabilities, influenced by game conditions.

Class Structure: Exploring Day vs. Player class interactions.

Next Steps

Finalize object-oriented design approach. (Completed)

Implement basic event and resource management mechanics. (Completed)

Establish core game loop and testing framework. (Completed)

Determine database schema and integration strategy. (Completed)

New Next Steps after Sprint 1

Integrate Frontend with the Backend

Populate the SQL database and begin further testing fir the Event class
